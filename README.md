# fire-detection-model
Create a machine learning model to accurately detect fires using sensor data from experiments and real-world settings. I preprocessed data, handled missing values and imbalances, and applied Random Forest, XGBoost, and SMOTE. The goal is a reliable, real-time detection system with a user-friendly pipeline for training, evaluation, and deployment.
